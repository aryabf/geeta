As you have probably noticed, this game is HEAVILY inspired by [HoloCure](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2420510/HoloCure__Save_the_Fans/), a roguelike game developed by [KayAnimate](https://store.steampowered.com/search/?developer=KayAnimate).

This game also contains several assets from other sources that will be credited [later in this document](https://github.com/aryabf/geeta/edit/main/README.md#credits).

This scene starts stage 1 level 1 of Geeta. This stage is the orientation of the game. It gives you an easy start and introduction to the game's core mechanics.

### 1-2
This scene starts stage 2 level 1 of Geeta. This stage is slightly harder than stage 1, which gives more health to the enemies (previously, all enemies are one hit).

### 1-3
This scene starts stage 3 level 1 of Geeta. This stage is the final stage provided in this game. Stage 3 has a unique feature which is a final boss. In order to complete this level, you need to beat the boss before the time runs out.
